First create React then install json server and formic yup, then create a Regristation.jsx file then use import Yup to handle forms and Yup for validation. Create a form with three fields: Username, Email, and Password. Validate input with Yup (for example, username at least 3 characters, email valid, password at least 6 characters). After successful validation, send data to JSON Server with a POST request. After that, create a Login.jsx file, the same as Regristation.jsx, except that we have to use get to go to the JSON Server to check whether the email and password match the existing data. save the user ID in localStorage and redirect to the dashboard page. Then create a Dashboard to display the user's username and provide a button to log out.
